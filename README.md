## AR-Filter-app
This app has some exciting AR Filters to play with. These Filters are developed using unity and then it was exported to Android Studios to achieve more enhances in functionality.

### How did we do it 
1. First we created an app in Unity which has AR Filters in which the user can click the snapshot and the app stores that snap into storage at a specific location and the app terminates itself.
2. Second we created the app library and imported it to Android Studios where we made an app which takes the latest snap from the folder where the unity app stored the snaps and display it in the imageview.
3. The user also has option to upload it to FireStore.

**Step 3.** Open the settings.gradle file and on 10th line change the address to the address where you have downloaded the unity library.
